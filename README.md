    <b>This API is designed to practice and demonstrate authentication and authorization using Laravel Sanctum. It includes comprehensive study and implementation of middlewares, with a focus on creating a global Gate and an associated Policy for access control.

Additionally, the project incorporates seeders, migrations, and factories to facilitate testing and ensure robust development practices.</b>
